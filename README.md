# Portfolio-optimization-with-MC-Sim-and-Fib-Retracement
Obtain a portfolio with the optimal result through Monte Carlos simulation and Fibonacci Retracement

The project uses Virginia Tech SEED's real energy portfolio as a sample portfolio

The Monte Carlos Simulation was ran 5 times with 10 thousand trials
The optimal portfolio was created based the average of portfolio weight of the stocks
After the optimal portfolio was created, Fibonacci Retracement levels were established to determine possible support and resistance levels.
